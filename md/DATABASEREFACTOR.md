# Database Refactor Summary for BioMatch

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactor performed on the database codebase for the BioMatch Blood Management System project. The goal of the refactor was to modularize the database logic, improve maintainability, and enable easier feature expansion.

---

## Motivation

- **Separation of Concerns:** Previously, all database logic was contained in a single `database.py` file, making it difficult to maintain and extend.
- **Scalability:** As features grew, a monolithic file became cumbersome and error-prone.
- **Readability:** Modular code allows for easier reading, debugging, and onboarding of new developers.

---

## Refactor Details

### 1. **Modularization**

The original `database.py` file was broken down into multiple modules, each responsible for a specific domain:

- `db_init.py` — Database initialization and table creation.
- `hospital.py` — Hospital-related CRUD operations.
- `user.py` — User authentication and management.
- `donation.py` — Blood donation logic.
- `inventory.py` — Inventory management and search.
- `transaction.py` — Transaction and request management.
- `donor.py` — Donor registry and eligibility management.

All modules are located inside the `backend/database/` directory.

### 2. **Database Package Structure**

Directory after refactor:

```
backend/
  database/
    __init__.py
    db_init.py
    hospital.py
    user.py
    donation.py
    inventory.py
    transaction.py
    donor.py
    biomatch.db (generated at runtime)
```

### 3. **Database Initialization**

- All table creation logic is now in `db_init.py`.  
- The `initialize_db()` function creates tables if they do not exist, including new tables such as `donors`.

### 4. **Package Exports**

- The `database/__init__.py` file explicitly imports and re-exports key functions from each module.
- This enables `from database import ...` to work cleanly in the Flask app and elsewhere.

Example:
```python
from .db_init import initialize_db
from .hospital import register_hospital, get_all_hospitals, get_hospital_by_id
from .user import create_user, authenticate_user
from .donation import add_donation, get_donations_by_hospital
from .inventory import get_inventory_by_hospital, search_blood_across_hospitals, search_available_blood_units
from .transaction import create_transaction, get_transactions_by_hospital, get_all_transactions, update_transaction_status, get_transaction_statistics
from .donor import add_donor, get_all_donors, update_donor_eligibility, delete_donor
```

### 5. **Removal of Monolithic `database.py`**

- The original `database.py` script is deleted (or gitignored), preventing import conflicts and ensuring use of the new package.

---

## New Features Enabled

- **Donor Registry:** Dedicated `donors` table and management functions, supporting admin and anonymized views.
- **Cleaner Imports:** Each concern is imported explicitly, reducing namespace pollution and bugs.
- **Easier Testing:** Functions can be tested individually, and new features can be added as new modules.

---

## Usage Example

In `app.py`, database functions are now imported as:

```python
from database import (
    initialize_db,
    register_hospital,
    get_all_hospitals,
    # ... other imports
    add_donor,
    get_all_donors,
    update_donor_eligibility,
    delete_donor
)
```

## Conclusion

This refactor brings the BioMatch backend in line with best practices for modular Python development, paving the way for easier maintenance and future growth.
