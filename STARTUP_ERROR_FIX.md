# 🐛 Startup Error Fixed

## ❌ Problem

When opening the app, a popup error appeared:
```
Error: No hospital information found
```

This happened **before login**, which doesn't make sense.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The error was caused by pages trying to load data during app initialization:

1. **hospital_blood_requests_page.py**:
   - Had `self.after(100, self.load_requests)` in `__init__`
   - Called `load_requests()` immediately on app startup
   - `load_requests()` showed error popup if no hospital was logged in

2. **transaction_history_page.py**:
   - Had `self.after(100, self.load_transactions)` in `__init__`
   - Called `load_transactions()` immediately on app startup
   - `load_transactions()` showed error popup if no hospital was logged in

### Timeline:
```
App Starts
    ↓
All pages created (including Blood Requests & Transactions)
    ↓
__init__ runs → self.after(100, self.load_requests)
    ↓
load_requests() runs BEFORE login
    ↓
No hospital info exists yet
    ↓
❌ Error popup: "No hospital information found"
```

---

## ✅ Solution

Changed both pages to **silently return** if no hospital is logged in, instead of showing an error:

### **hospital_blood_requests_page.py**

**BEFORE**:
```python
if not hospital_id:
    messagebox.showerror("Error", "No hospital information found")
    return
```

**AFTER**:
```python
if not hospital_id:
    # Silently return if no hospital ID (user not logged in)
    return
```

### **transaction_history_page.py**

**BEFORE**:
```python
if not hospital_id:
    messagebox.showerror("Error", "No hospital information found")
    return
```

**AFTER**:
```python
if not hospital_id:
    # Silently return if no hospital ID (user not logged in)
    return
```

## 🎯 Why This Works

1. **Before Login**: Pages are created but `load_requests()`/`load_transactions()` just return silently
2. **After Login**: When user navigates to these pages, `refresh_data()` is called
3. **Data Loads**: Hospital info is available, data loads successfully
4. **No Errors**: No popup errors during startup

### New Flow:
```
App Starts
    ↓
All pages created
    ↓
load_requests() runs → No hospital → Silently returns ✅
    ↓
User sees Welcome Page (no errors) ✅
    ↓
User logs in
    ↓
Navigate to Blood Requests page
    ↓
refresh_data() called → Hospital exists → Data loads ✅
```
