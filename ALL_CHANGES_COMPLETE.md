# üéâ BioMatch - ALL CHANGES COMPLETE! üéâ

## ‚úÖ ALL 10 REQUIREMENTS COMPLETED

### 1. ‚úÖ Remove Low Stock Alerts from Dashboard

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Changes:**

- Removed "Low Stock Alerts" stat card from `UnifiedDashboardPage`
- Dashboard now shows 3 stats: Total Units, Pending Requests, Total Requests

### 2. ‚úÖ Make Blood Inventory BIGGER

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Changes:**

- Blood inventory: **85% width** (was 70%), **15 rows** height (was 10)
- Donation form: **15% width** (was 30%), minimal compact design
- Column widths increased: 120/150/200px
- Empty space eliminated

### 3. ‚úÖ Fix Request Blood Feature Logic (SENDING POINT)

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Changes:**

- `BloodRequestPage` now shows **SENT requests** (from current hospital)
- Filters by `requesting_hospital_id = current_hospital`
- Table title: "Sent Requests (From This Hospital)"
- Shows: Request ID, To Hospital, Blood Type, Units, Status, Date

### 4. ‚úÖ Fix Blood Requests Feature Logic (RECEIVING POINT)

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Changes:**

- `HospitalBloodRequestsPage` now shows **RECEIVED requests** (to current hospital)
- Filters by `source_hospital_id = current_hospital`
- Table title: "Received Blood Requests (From Other Hospitals)"
- Added columns: ID, **From Hospital**, Blood Type, Units, Priority, Status, Date
- Added action buttons:
  - ‚úì Approve Selected
  - ‚úó Reject Selected
  - üîÑ Refresh
  - ‚Ñπ View Details

**Backend Endpoints Added:**

- `PUT /blood_requests/<request_id>/approve` - Approves request, updates inventory, creates transactions
- `PUT /blood_requests/<request_id>/reject` - Rejects request, no inventory changes

### 5. ‚úÖ Hospital-Specific Data Filtering

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Changes:**

- **Backend:** Added `GET /blood_requests/<hospital_id>` endpoint
- Returns requests where hospital is EITHER sender OR receiver
- **Frontend:** Both pages filter results:
  - Request Blood: Shows only `requesting_hospital_id = current_hospital`
  - Blood Requests: Shows only `source_hospital_id = current_hospital`
- **Result:** Hospital C sees NOTHING about Hospital A ‚Üî Hospital B transactions

### 6. ‚úÖ Search with Request Button

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Changes:**

- Search bar in header (all authenticated pages via `BasePage`)
- Search flow:
  1. Enter blood type (e.g., "AB+")
  2. Click search
  3. Results window shows hospitals with that blood
  4. Table columns: Blood Type, Units, Hospital, Address, Contact, **‚û§ Request**
  5. Double-click any hospital ‚Üí Opens full request form
- **Request Form Fields:**
  - Blood Type (pre-filled)
  - Units Needed
  - Patient Name
  - Patient ID
  - Requesting Doctor
  - Priority (Normal/Urgent/Emergency)
  - Purpose (text area)
- Submits to `POST /blood_requests/create`

**Backend Endpoint Added:**

- `POST /blood_requests/create` - Creates hospital-to-hospital blood request

### 7. ‚úÖ Combine Registration

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Changes:**

- **Welcome Page:** Only ONE registration button now
  - üè• Register New Hospital
  - ~~Register User Account~~ (REMOVED)
- **RegisterHospitalPage:** Creates hospital with default password
  - Default password: `hospital123`
  - Shows Hospital ID after registration
  - Copy to clipboard button
- **Backend:** Hospital registration already creates hospital entity

### 8. ‚úÖ Minimize/Maximize Button

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Changes:**

- **BasePage:** Added `toggle_maximize()` method
- Button in header next to user info
- Toggles between:
  - `state('zoomed')` - Maximized
  - `state('normal')` - Windowed
- Button text updates: "‚¨ú Maximize" ‚Üî "üóó Restore"
- NO MORE exit fullscreen button

### 9. ‚úÖ Database Initialization

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Verification:**

- `blood_requests` table already has:
  - `requesting_hospital_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí hospitals.id)
  - `source_hospital_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí hospitals.id)
  - `patient_name`, `patient_id`, `requesting_doctor`
  - `priority`, `purpose`, `status`, `notes`
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` timestamps
- Supports all hospital-specific filtering
- Approve/reject logic uses these fields
